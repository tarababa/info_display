Using the output from the meteo module temprature, humidity and barometric pressure information is aggragated and shown in
in the form of graphs on the display module.

Furthermore weatherforecast data is pulled from the yr.no rss and can be viewed on the display. 

Navigation through the various menus is done through the six buttons which are integrated in the Yocto display module.
